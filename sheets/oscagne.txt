-Legacy-
Neocologist (Tome of the Watchtowers, pg 155)

Attainments:
Barrier Breaking:  This Attainment functions as a combination of Spirit Tongue and Peer Across the Gauntlet, allowing 
the Neocologist to know exactly what the state of the spiritual landscape around him is.  These mages effectively operate 
on both sides of the Gauntlet at will.  They see spirits, and spirits see them.  This Attainment is always in effect and of 
indefinite duration.  For followers of this Legacy, viewing events taking place in the Shadow Realm is no more difficult 
than looking in the right direction.  Additionally, the mage also gains a particular awareness of the spirits of living beings. 
He senses the health of a scraggly tree in an urban blight zone and the vitality of a wolf that's stalking him; he senses 
anomalies or overlapping of spiritual "signatures" if there are two spirits in one body (as in the case of an embryo or other 
parasites).
